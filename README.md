# The Jarvis project
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model which will be able to read the hand location and gesture from camera feed in real-time. The model will then be paired with a program, which will use the data to control the PC, as if the hand was a mouse.

In case it's hard for you to imagine, this is the aim:

## Todo
- [x] find a way to extract frames from videos
- [x] create a script to help with frame labelling process
- [ ] create the varied dataset
- [ ] develop the machine learning model
- [ ] develop software to translate the data from the model into mouse cursor movements
- [ ] implement clicking
- [ ] implement grabbing/dragging and dropping
- [ ] implement changing the virtual screen through waving
